# Pine

Pine is a free, open-source, cross-platform Elm runtime environment that lets developers create servers, web apps, and command line tools.

+ Pine supports building and running Elm programs natively on .NET without JavaScript.
+ The Elm compilation interfaces support the customization of code generation at build time.
+ Pine comes bundled with an integrated web server and database management system, simplifying the development and operation of web services.

## Web Services

+ Pine integrates web server and database management system, automating the persistence and maintenance of application state and database migrations.
+ Run reports or custom updates as Elm functions on your database via the admin interface.

## Getting Started

Download the pre-built Pine binary for your platform at <https://pine-vm.org/download>, or on the [releases page](https://github.com/pine-vm/pine/releases) on GitHub.

The `pine` executable file integrates all functionality to build apps and operate web services.

The command below runs a server and deploys a full-stack web app:

```txt
pine  run-server  --public-urls="http://*:5000"  --deploy=https://github.com/pine-vm/pine/tree/3a5c9d0052ab344984bafa5094d2debc3ad1ecb7/implement/example-apps/docker-image-default-app
```


## Docker Image

To deploy in a docker container, use the `pine-vm/pine` image from the [GitHub Container registry](https://github.com/pine-vm/pine/pkgs/container/pine) (`ghcr.io/pine-vm/pine`). The tags are aligned with the version IDs in the CLI executable file.

```txt
docker  run  -p 5000:80  -p 4000:4000  --env "APPSETTING_adminPassword=test"  ghcr.io/pine-vm/pine
```

## Example Apps

### Rich Chat Room

The [rich chat room example app](https://github.com/pine-vm/pine/tree/main/implement/example-apps/rich-chat-room) demonstrates features typically found in a chat app, such as user names, message rate-limiting, sound effects, etc.
For a detailed description of this app, see the readme file at <https://github.com/pine-vm/pine/blob/main/implement/example-apps/rich-chat-room/README.md>

### Elm Editor

[Elm Editor](https://github.com/pine-vm/pine/tree/main/implement/example-apps/elm-editor) is a web app for developing Elm programs.

As an integrated development environment, it assists us in reading, writing, and testing Elm programs and in collaborating with other developers.
