# Pine Language

The Pine language is a side‑effect‑free compilation target designed to unlock the next level of automation in software development.

The design of Pine enables runtimes to automatically distribute work across local threads, heterogeneous hardware, and multiple machines, without requiring developers to code for concurrency, memory management, or network boundaries.
